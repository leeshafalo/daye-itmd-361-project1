            <p>
              I like watching movies. They show me various new things. And when I was watching movie, I can feel the movie's main character is like myself. That's why I like watching movies.

          <li>Reading fantasy books
            <p>
              I like reading fantasy books. Because many fantasy books have a different view of the world. They are really surprising and wonderful. And sometimes they make me think about our life and future.

          <li>Listening Musics
            <p>
              I also like listening music. Sometimes when I start study, I listen music. It helps me concentrate. Also, when I stay alone, listening music gives me comfort and relax.
